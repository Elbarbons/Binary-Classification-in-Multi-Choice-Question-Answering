A part-time job can teach teenagers important skills like responsibility , independence ,teamwork and leadership.\nYoung people can expand  their social circles beyond their classmates by making friends with co-workers. And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14.

High tech is just a shorter way of saying high technology. And high technology describes any invention or system that uses the newest ideas or discoveries of science and engineering.\nWhat is high tech? A computer is high tech. So is a communications satellite. A modern manufacturing     system is surely high tech.\nHigh tech became a popular expression in the United States during the early 1980's. Because of improvements in technology, people could buy many new kinds of products in American stores, such as home computers, microwave ovens  , etc. \"State of the art\" is something that is as modern as possible. It is a product that is based on the very latest ways and technology. Something that is \"state of the art\" is the newest possible design or product of a business or industry. A state of the art television set, for example, uses the most modern electronic design and parts. It is the best that one can buy.\n\"State of the art\" is not a new expression. Engineers have used it for years, to describe the best and most modern way of doing something.\nMillions of Americans began to use the expression in the late 1970's. The reason was the computer revolution . Every computer company claimed   that its computers were \"state of the art\".\nComputer technology changes so fast that a state of the art computer today might be old tomorrow.

The fourth, who took hold of the elephant's tail, insisted that it was like a rope. The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arms around one of the elephant's legs. The last, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan.\nEach man's idea of the animal came from his own experience. So if someone disagrees with you about a \"simple fact\", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours.\nTo see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a \"simple fact\", try this simple experiment. Get three large bowls. Put ice water in one. Put hot water in the second. Put lukewarm water  in the third. Now put your left hand in the hot water. Put your right hand in the lukewarm water. Your right hand will tell you the water is cold. Your left hand will tell you it is hot.", "choice0": "learn from the blind men", "choice1": "not agree about simple facts", "choice2": "never think about simple facts", "choice3": "never decide anything with one side", "label": 3}

 {"context": "Question: What is train-spotting according to the passage?\n Context: Train-spotting\nMany people around the world have seen Danny Boyle's movie Train spotting starring Ewan McGregor, but how many of us really know what train-spotting is all about? Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

But if you use one for hours without stopping - as do millions of college students, business travelers, telecommuters, video-gamers and growing numbers of office workers - your body may feel hurt.

Some musicians, such as Great Big Sea's Alan Doyle, are holding special concerts, with the money going to Fort McMurray people. And companies have been helping, as well. Beer-maker Labatt filled thousands of cans with water--instead of beer--and sent them to the people in Fort McMurray.\nThe fire is huge, spreading over more than 229,000 hectares  , but firefighters say they believe they are starting to get it under control--it is becoming smaller instead of spreading.", "choice0": "A big fire in Fort McMurray of Canada.", "choice1": "The people in Fort McMurray of Canada.", "choice2": "The firefighters in Fort McMurray of Canada.", "choice3": "The musicians in Fort McMurray of Canada.", "label": 0}
 {"context": "Question: How did Little Kids Rock help the school?\n Context: Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students.

He lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to live with us.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.\"\n\"No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us.\"\n\"Son,\" said the father, \"you don't know what you're asking. Someone like the young man would be a terrible burden for us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let something like this stay with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He'll find a way to live on his own.\"\nAt that point, the son hung up the phone. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling down from a building. The police believed it was suicide .\nThe parents flew to San Francisco. To their surprise, they found their son had only one arm and one leg.\nThe parents in this story are like many of us.

 {"context": "Question: What should their parents do when teenagers make friends?\n Context: Having friends, and finding new friendships is an important developmental task for preteens and teens. While they have learned to play well with others during their childhood, developing independent friendships is a different thing. Preteens and teens will be allowed to use their own resources to decide whether to be someone's friend or not, instead of being taught by their parents. Parents must give their teenagers some freedom in choosing who they want to hang out with.\nYou can help your teens to choose their friends, although it's your teenagers who make the final decision. You can use teachable moments to talk about what makes a good friend.

They can be brown,purple,green.They can be as small as 3 cm long and as large as 3 m long.\nThe best time to see earthworms is at night,especially a cool,damp night.That's when they come up from their burrows to hunt for food.Earthworms don't like to be in the sun.That's because they breathe through their skin,and they can't breathe if their skin gets too dry.Earthworms must come out of the earth if it rains a lot,because they can't breathe in their flooded burrows.What a dangerous life!\nEarthworms don't have eyes,so how can they tell when it's dark?

They study and they watch television,\" Ian Morgan of the Australian National University told AFP.\nBut being a bookworm or a couch potato does not directly harm the eyes, added Morgan. \"As long as they get outside, it doesn't seem to matter how much study they do,\" he explained. \"There are some kids who study hard and get outside and play hard and they are generally fine. The ones who are at major risk are the ones who study hard and don't get outside. As a result of massive   educational pressures and the construction   of a child's day, the amount of time they spend outside in bright light is minimized.\"\nExperts suggest children should stay outside for two to three hours every day.

 {"context": "Question: This passage mainly talks about   _  .\n Context: For many years, a small percentage of homeowners have fixed solar panels   on their rooftops. Those panels collect some of the sun's energy and either change it into electricity or use it to heat water. Until recently, the panels were too expensive for average homeowners, and their designs were not attractive. Thanks to new advances, however, solar panels for homes are becoming cheaper and less large and heavy. Now more homeowners are considering using them.\nStores begin to sell Solar panels\nLast fall furniture retailer  IKEA began selling solar panels in its U.K. stores. IKEA has brought the DIY solar choice to the public. While shopping for furniture, shoppers could not add a box or two of solar panels to their shopping cart  . IKEA is partnering with a company. The company deals with fixing and servcing of the solar panels on the roofs. So it is easy for customers to change from old energy system to solar system. If all goes well, IKEA plans to begin selling the panels in other countries soon.\nStylish solar panels\nSolTech, a Swedish company, offers a really great solar-power solution. Instead of flat panels, SolTech covers the panels with a special glass tile.  And the shape of the glass tile fits traditional tiled roof designs. SolTech recently offers solar systems that heat the home's air or water. And it also offers one solar system that produces electricity.\n _ \nNew technology has turned windows into solar panels.

 {"context": "Question: The reason why only a few homeowners used solar panels is that they are   _  .\n Context: For many years, a small percentage of homeowners have fixed solar panels   on their rooftops. Those panels collect some of the sun's energy and either change it into electricity or use it to heat water. Until recently, the panels were too expensive for average homeowners, and their designs were not attractive. Thanks to new advances, however, solar panels for homes are becoming cheaper and less large and heavy. Now more homeowners are considering using them.\nStores begin to sell Solar panels\nLast fall furniture retailer  IKEA began selling solar panels in its U.K. stores. IKEA has brought the DIY solar choice to the public. While shopping for furniture, shoppers could not add a box or two of solar panels to their shopping cart  . IKEA is partnering with a company. The company deals with fixing and servcing of the solar panels on the roofs. So it is easy for customers to change from old energy system to solar system. If all goes well, IKEA plans to begin selling the panels in other countries soon.\nStylish solar panels\nSolTech, a Swedish company, offers a really great solar-power solution. Instead of flat panels, SolTech covers the panels with a special glass tile.  And the shape of the glass tile fits traditional tiled roof designs. SolTech recently offers solar systems that heat the home's air or water. And it also offers one solar system that produces electricity.\n _ \nNew technology has turned windows into solar panels.

I tried my best to work out the hard problems, but the numbers I came up with were strange. I sat back on my chair and looked for any possible answers, but I could not remember anything or think correctly. I started thinking about my dad coming home from work to find that I failed the test ...\n\"How could you have failed the test? I am certain that nobody else in the whole class got as bad a grade as you did!\"\nNaturally I didn't want that to happen. My dad was also really busy at work at present, so I was afraid that this might make him mad. When feeling hopeless, I noticed that my table partner was writing fast on his test. I could see smoke rising up from how fast he was writing. I was attracted to look over at his test, but then the many bad results I had heard about cheating   came into my mind. I reasoned that if I started cheating now, it would be hard to give up that habit during high school. In the end, I decided not to copy his answers, and got a B- on that test. Even though my dad gave me a hard time about it, it would have been a lot worse if he found out that I had given in and cheated.", "choice0": "could read Serbian", "choice1": "didn't cheat at last", "choice2": "got a good grade at last", "choice3": "didn't work hard that night", "label": 1}
