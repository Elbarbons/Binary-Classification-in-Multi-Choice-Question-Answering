Dou Kou was born in Jiangsu Province in 1994. When he was 7 months old, his parents started working in over 30 different cities, such as Xi'an and Shenzhen. This kind of life gave him things to think and write about.\nWhen Dou Kou was 9 months old, he could speak and at the age of one he could say five to six hundred words. At 3, he could look up words in the dictionary. At 4, his father taught him to learn something. His parents like reading very much. So does he. At the age of 5, he began writing fairy tales.\nHis fairy tales are all from his life. One day, he found many mice in the house. They not only ate their food but also hurt his mother's hand. So he thought, \"If we give mice the stomachs (  ) of cows, they'll eat grass and it'll be helpful to people. \" This was his first fairy tale \"Change Stomachs for Mice\". At 6, he wrote a novel about his own life in different cities with his parents.\nNow, he studies well in a middle school. He has written his third book, the novel called \"Eyes of Childhood\". He says, \"I am not different from other children.

Most Chinese hotels often provide guests with things like disposable  toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and slippers. Many guests like the idea because they don't have to bring their own.

They want to ask people to use less disposable things.\nMany disposable things are made of plastic. People throw them away after only using them once. It is a waste of natural resources  and is very bad for the environment. Do you know, one Chinese makes as much as 400kg of waste a year! Most of that waste comes from disposable things. In Beijing, people throw away about 19,000 tons of plastic bags and1,320 tons of plastic lunch bowls every year! Plastic can take between 100 and 400 years to break down. So the less plastic we throw out, the better. So, wherever you travel, bring your own things and use them again and again.\nBack at home and at school, you can also do something, you can also do something to make our world a better place.

Looking through a microscope, Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water.

He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs. If he killed these germs, maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible. He tried with different ways to kill the germs. In the end he found heating   the wine seemed to work best. The winemaker tried it, and every bottle of wine tasted good.\nPasteur's idea worked for other people, too.

They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well.\nAnd I also do some exercises from our class magazines, and I often write English diaries.

What's the difference between fog and smog?\nAccording to scientists, fog is made up of tiny   drops of water and also ice particles   during very cold conditions. Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities.\nAn official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter  .\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal.\nPoor air has done harm to people's health. Children and the elderly are more at risk. A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory   problems.\nTo respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action.\nBeijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions   should be banned and factories should be closely watched.\nThree students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. \"We hope more people will join us to protect our environment. With all our efforts, the blue skies will certainly return soon,\" said Shi Yucong, 15, one of the three students.", "choice0": "A report about air pollution", "choice1": "Let's fight the air pollution", "choice2": "Dirty air is bad for us", "choice3": "The air in Beijing", "label": 1}

He found a group of family members shouting in anger at each other. He turned to his students and asked: \"Why do people shout in anger at each other?\"\nHis students thought for a while, and one of them said: \"Because when we lose our calm, we shout.\"\n\"But, why should you shout when the other person is just next to you? You can just as well tell him what you have to say in a soft manner,\" said the wise man.\nStudents gave some other answers but none were any good.\n\"When two people are angry at each other, their hearts become distanced,\" the wise man explained. \"To cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other. The angrier they are, the louder they will have to shout to hear each other and cover that great distance.\"\nThe wise man then gave an example: \"What happens when two people fall in love? They don't shout at each other but talk softly because their hearts are very close. When they love each other even more, what happens? They don't need to talk. They only look at each other and that's all.

With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold.\nMy favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

 {"context": "Question: What can be inferred from the passage?\n Context: Most students, who are learning a foreign language, like to choose Homestay when they study abroad. Others also prefer homestay even if they go on a visit or a holiday in another country. Presently,homestay has become a form of accommodation( ) which is very popular all around the world. If you want to\nstay at a comfortable and home-like house and experience the life of local people,\nyou can book a homestay on the Internet before you go abroad. It is easy for you to pick out a host family that you want to live with from all over the world. So what is homestay? And what makes it so popular nowadays?\nHomestay means living with a foreign family or \"host family\" as we stay abroad. It is usually called a home away home. There are three ways of doing it:\nChoose to learn English in a language school near your homestay where you\nlive ;\nHave your English classes in the house with a member of family who is a qualified    teacher;\nDon't have any classes at all when you visit a foreign country-a popular\nchoice if you want to be a tourist for example.\nEven in the busy summer period the organization that provides the homestays will always try to place you with the most suitable  host family to meet your needs. With the help of the organizations, you don't worry about where you live, your interests, your language level, eating habits, medical care and anything else you may have during the homestay.\nThough the price of homestay is,mainly depended on your needs, high-quality homestay accommodation can be relatively economical . And if you want your homestay in or near the city center, you may pay for an extra amount of money. Even if you stay further out. you can expect your journey into the center not to Go beyond 30 minutes.\nNot only does homestay accommodation represent  value for money,it also gives you an excellent opportunity to practice the foreign language with your host family.

But nobody answered.\nThen suddenly the light went out, and I was alone in the dark. I started to cry and beat the walls of the lift. I cried and cried until I had no voice left. Then, I felt hopeless, and pressed all the buttons with my open hands. And all at the same time, there was a bell far away . It rang and rang. It was the fire alarm . I thought the whole building was on fire. I said to god quietly, \"Just get me out of here. I'll never be bad again.\"\nJust then, I realized the lift was moving very slowly . On the ground floor it stopped, and the doors opened. A man was standing there. \"How long have you been there? It is good that you pressed the alarm bell. But haven't you learned to read at your school?\" He pointed at a small piece of paper on the wall beside the lift. It said: \"Attention: This lift will be stopped for repairs between 4pm and 5pm on Thursday March 13.\"", "choice0": "escaped from a fire accident", "choice1": "made a silly mistake.", "choice2": "visited a dishonest friend", "choice3": "pressed a wrong button.", "label": 1}

Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself? Well, obviously it's because we have mirror neurons   in our brains.\nPut simply, the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something, our brains model after it, whether or not we actually perform the same action. This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile, talk, walk, dance or play sports. But the idea goes further: mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions,they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people.\nMirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains,but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages,and to understand how other people feel. Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language. A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to (for example: \"The hand took hold of the ball\"), the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed (in this example, actually taking hold of a ball).\nAny problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior. Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning  . However, it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders.\nResearch into mirror neurons seems to provide us with ever more information about how humans behave, communicate and spend time together.

 {"context": "Question: Special teachers at the zoo  _  .\n Context: Zoos are places where different kinds of animals are Kept and shown for the public. At most modern zoos people can see, smell and hear animals in their natural way. Some zoos even have \"friendship farms\" where people can touch some of the animals. Here are four reasons why people need zoos.\nFirstly, zoos educate people about animals and their natural environment. They give interesting information about each animal, such as where it comes from and how it lives. Special teachers at the zoo help children to understand more about the animals. Trained guides show visitors around the zoo.\nSecondly, zoos are working hard to find out more about animals. New knowledge leads to improved ways of looking after animals in the zoo, and better understanding of the same animals in the wild.\nThirdly, zoos play a part in protecting animals and stopping them from disappearing. Zoos work together with each other to help the animals in danger. For example, gorillas  from Taronga Zoo were sent to live with gorillas at the Melbourne Zoo in the hope that they would give birth to babies.\nFinally, zoos are important for people's enjoyment. People enjoy getting close to animals without having to cross the plains of Africa or climb the mountains of China. In the past, animal shows were common in zoos.

 {"context": "Question: Which of the following is NOT TRUE according to the passage?\n Context: Zoos are places where different kinds of animals are Kept and shown for the public. At most modern zoos people can see, smell and hear animals in their natural way. Some zoos even have \"friendship farms\" where people can touch some of the animals. Here are four reasons why people need zoos.\nFirstly, zoos educate people about animals and their natural environment. They give interesting information about each animal, such as where it comes from and how it lives. Special teachers at the zoo help children to understand more about the animals. Trained guides show visitors around the zoo.\nSecondly, zoos are working hard to find out more about animals. New knowledge leads to improved ways of looking after animals in the zoo, and better understanding of the same animals in the wild.\nThirdly, zoos play a part in protecting animals and stopping them from disappearing. Zoos work together with each other to help the animals in danger. For example, gorillas  from Taronga Zoo were sent to live with gorillas at the Melbourne Zoo in the hope that they would give birth to babies.\nFinally, zoos are important for people's enjoyment. People enjoy getting close to animals without having to cross the plains of Africa or climb the mountains of China. In the past, animal shows were common in zoos. Visitors were excited by monkeys in human clothes, and they even took rides on elephants or horses.

 {"context": "Question: Which of the following sentences is NOT true from the passage?\n Context: Are you happy most of the time? Or do you easily get angry sometimes? Everyone has a different temperament . It is usually believed that both genes  and environment may affect people's temperaments in different ways. Scientists have found that the season of the birth also plays a role.\nScientists from Budapest, Hungary, studied 400 university students. In the study, the students need to finish a questionnaire . The purpose of it was to find out which of four kinds of temperaments they most had.

In 1956, the people of a town in the USA saw a small black cloud in the sky. It started to rain from the cloud normally, but only in a small area. The cloud then turned white, and fish started to fall to the ground.

When they went outside, they found all types of frogs covering four streets.\nThere are other reports of strange \"rains\" failing from the sky including worms, insects and snakes.\nCan these strange \"rains\" be explained by science? Scientists usually say that a tornado   has picked up the animals from a river or ocean, carried them for miles, and then dropped them somewhere else. But this does not completely explain all of them. On May 15, 1890, in Italy, there was a rain of birds' blood. Scientists said that flying birds must have been torn   to pieces by strong winds.

Later, as teenagers, the two danced in many shows throughout the United States. Their first big success was on Broadway in 1917.\nThe Astaires -- as they were known --- became Broadway stars. However, in 1932, Adele Astaire married a British man, and stopped performing. But Fred did not give up his dream. He would go on alone, in the movies.\nFred said, \"Dancing is a sweaty job. You cannot just sit down and do it. You have to get up on your feet. It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable. I always try to get to know my dance so well that I do not have to think.\"\nIn 1949, Fred Astaire won a special award for his film work from America's Motion Picture Academy. He also won awards from the television industry for a number of his television programs.[:ZXXK]\nFred stopped dancing in 1970. He was more than seventy years old at the time.
